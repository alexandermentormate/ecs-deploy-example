# ECS deployment
    This is the easier and cheaper alternative way of deploying our application. Instead of using EKS, we'll go with an alternative container orchestrating tool that AWS provides.
    ECS is a good choice for simple, single-service deployments in cases where we have a smaller projects with Docker containers and don't need the advanced features and flexibility provided by Kubernetes.
